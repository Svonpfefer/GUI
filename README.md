GUI

Matlab

The folder contains my Technical Analysis coursework where I wrote a matlab gui to count the number of elliot waves in a price series.
The Gui can import FX data, and stock data from either matlab or yahoo finance. 
The Gui also has a zig-zag component, where the price series is filtered for changes greater then a certain amount.
